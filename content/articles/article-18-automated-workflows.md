# Building Your First Automated Workflow

Automation transforms repetitive work from a time sink into a set-it-and-forget-it process. This tutorial walks you through building a complete automated workflow in Life OS.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have an automated research workflow that:

1. Accepts a research topic from you
2. Searches multiple sources for relevant information
3. Synthesizes findings into a structured report
4. Saves the report to your knowledge base
5. Sends you a notification when complete

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Life OS installed and running
- At least 3 genesis agents deployed
- A configured channel (Telegram or Discord)
- Basic familiarity with your terminal

## Step 1: Design Your Workflow

Every workflow begins with a clear definition. Write out the steps:

```
1. User provides research topic
2. Parse topic and create search queries
3. Execute searches (parallel)
4. Collect and deduplicate results
5. Generate summary using AI
6. Format as markdown report
7. Save to knowledge base
8. Notify user with link
```

## Step 2: Create the Workflow File

Workflows live in the `automation/workflows` directory. Create a new file:

```yaml
# automation/workflows/research-assistant.yaml
name: research-assistant
description: Automated research and report generation

triggers:
  - type: command
    pattern: "research {topic}"

actions:
  - name: parse_topic
    type: transformation
    input: "{{trigger.payload.topic}}"
    output: queries
    
  - name: execute_search
    type: agent
    agent: web-search
    input: "{{queries.search_terms}}"
    output: search_results
    parallel: true
    
  - name: synthesize
    type: agent
    agent: ai-synthesizer
    input: "{{search_results}}"
    output: report
    
  - name: save_report
    type: file
    path: "knowledge/reports/{{date}}/{{topic}}.md"
    content: "{{report}}"
    
  - name: notify_user
    type: notification
    channel: telegram
    message: "Research complete: {{topic}}"
```

## Step 3: Implement Custom Actions

Some workflows require custom logic beyond standard actions. Create a Python module:

```python
# automation/workflows/research/synthesize.py
from pathlib import Path

def synthesize_research(search_results: list, topic: str) -> str:
    """Synthesize multiple search results into a coherent report."""
    
    # Deduplicate by URL
    seen_urls = set()
    unique_results = []
    for result in search_results:
        if result['url'] not in seen_urls:
            seen_urls.add(result['url'])
            unique_results.append(result)
    
    # Generate report structure
    report = f"# Research Report: {topic}\n\n"
    report += f"*Generated by Life OS on {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}*\n\n"
    
    # Group by theme (simplified)
    themes = group_by_theme(unique_results)
    
    for theme, items in themes.items():
        report += f"## {theme}\n\n"
        for item in items[:5]:  # Top 5 per theme
            report += f"- [{item['title']}]({item['url']})\n"
            report += f"  - {item['snippet'][:200]}...\n"
        report += "\n"
    
    # Add sources
    report += "## Sources\n\n"
    for item in unique_results[:20]:
        report += f"- [{item['title']}]({item['url']})\n"
    
    return report

def group_by_theme(results: list) -> dict:
    """Simple clustering by keyword matching."""
    themes = {
        'Overview': [],
        'Technical Details': [],
        'Practical Applications': [],
        'Future Trends': [],
        'Challenges': []
    }
    
    keywords = {
        'Overview': ['introduction', 'what is', 'overview', 'summary'],
        'Technical Details': ['how', 'technical', 'architecture', 'implementation'],
        'Practical Applications': ['use', 'application', 'example', 'case study'],
        'Future Trends': ['future', 'upcoming', 'roadmap', 'evolution'],
        'Challenges': ['challenge', 'problem', 'limitation', 'issue']
    }
    
    for result in results:
        text = (result['title'] + ' ' + result['snippet']).lower()
        scored = {theme: sum(1 for kw in kws if kw in text) 
                  for theme, kws in keywords.items()}
        best_theme = max(scored, key=scored.get) or 'Overview'
        themes[best_theme].append(result)
    
    return themes
```

## Step 4: Register the Workflow

Make Life OS aware of your new workflow:

```bash
openclaw workflow register automation/workflows/research-assistant.yaml
```

Verify registration:

```bash
openclaw workflow list
# Should show: research-assistant
```

## Step 5: Test Incrementally

Test each component before the full workflow:

```bash
# Test the synthesizer directly
python -c "
from synthesize import synthesize_research
results = [{'title': 'Test', 'url': 'http://test.com', 'snippet': 'Test snippet'}]
report = synthesize_research(results, 'Test Topic')
print(report[:500])
"
```

## Step 6: Run Your Workflow

Trigger the workflow through your connected channel:

```
@lifeos research AI agents in healthcare
```

The system responds:

```
🔍 Starting research on "AI agents in healthcare"
   └── Parsing topic... ✓
   └── Searching (3 queries)... ✓
   └── Synthesizing... ✓
   └── Saving report... ✓
   
✅ Complete! Report saved to: knowledge/reports/2026-02-05/ai-agents-in-healthcare.md
```

## Step 7: Monitor and Iterate

After running, check the execution log:

```bash
openclaw workflow logs research-assistant --tail
```

Look for:
- Execution time per action
- Any errors or warnings
- Areas for optimization

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Workflow Never Triggers

Check that your trigger pattern matches your input:

```yaml
# Wrong - extra spaces
trigger:
  pattern: "research {topic}"

# Right - handles all variations  
trigger:
  pattern: "research{*topic}"
```

### Actions Running Out of Order

Ensure dependencies are properly declared:

```yaml
# Wrong - assumes parallel by default
- name: save
  type: file
  # Missing input dependency

# Right - explicit dependency
- name: save  
  type: file
  depends_on: synthesize
```

### Too Many API Calls

Add rate limiting:

```yaml
- name: search
  type: agent
  agent: web-search
  rate_limit: 10  # Maximum per minute
```

## Extending the Workflow

Once your basic workflow runs, enhance it:

### Add Branching Logic

```yaml
- name: classify_topic
  type: conditional
  input: "{{topic}}"
  branches:
    - condition: "{{'technical' in topic.lower()}}"
      actions: [detailed_search]
    - condition: "{{'news' in topic.lower()}}"
      actions: [quick_search, recent_first]
    - default: [standard_search]
```

### Add Human Approval Gates

```yaml
- name: review_report
  type: approval
  approvers: ["user"]
  timeout: 24h
  on_approve: [publish_report]
  on_reject: [notify_creator]
```

### Add Error Recovery

```yaml
- name: sensitive_search
  type: agent
  retry:
    max_attempts: 3
    backoff: exponential
    on_failure: [notify_admin, log_incident]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start simple** - Begin with 3-5 actions, add complexity gradually
2. **Log extensively** - Every action should produce logs
3. **Handle failures** - Assume everything will fail eventually
4. **Document inputs** - Clearly define expected payloads
5. **Test in isolation** - Verify each action before chaining
6. **Version your workflows** - Track changes over time

## Conclusion

Automated workflows are the muscle of Life OS—taking the cognitive load off your shoulders and putting it on the system. The workflow you built today can handle research. Tomorrow, you might automate:

- Morning briefings
- Weekly reports
- Content calendars
- System monitoring
- Incident response

Every repetitive task is a candidate for automation. Your job is to identify patterns and teach Life OS to handle them.
